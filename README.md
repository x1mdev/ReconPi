ReconPi - A lightweight recon tool that performs extensive reconnaissance with the latest tools using a Raspberry Pi.

Start using that Raspberry Pi -- I know you all have one laying around somewhere ;)

> Since version 2.1 ReconPi is usable on your VPS, thanks to [Sachin Grover](https://github.com/mavericknerd) for putting in a lot of work.

We recommend using [axiom](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom) for setting up your VPS infrastructure.

The latest [HypriotOS](https://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/) image works perfect for Raspberry Pi's!

### Easy installation

Connect to your ReconPi or VPS with SSH:

`ssh pirate@192.168.2.16 [Edit IP address if needed]`

Curl the `install.sh` script and run it:
`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x1mdev/ReconPi/master/install.sh | bash`

### Manual installation

Connect to your system with SSH:


`$ ssh pirate@192.168.2.16 [Edit IP address/username if needed]`

Now we can set up everything, it's quite simple:

 - `git clone https://github.com/x1mdev/ReconPi.git`
 - `cd ReconPi`
 - `./install.sh`

Grab a cup of coffee since this will take a while.

## Usage

After installing all of the dependencies for the ReconPi you can finally start doing some recon!

```
$ recon <domain.tld>
```

`recon.sh` will first gather resolvers for the given target, followed by subdomain enumeration and checking those assets for potential subdomain takeover. When this is done the IP addresses of the target are enumerated. Open ports will be discovered accompanied by a service scan provided by Nmap.

[Nuclei](https://github) and its templates have been implemented in the routine!

Finally the live targets will be screenshotted and evaluated to discover endpoints.

Results will be stored on the server and can be viewed by running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337" in your results directory. Your results will be accessible from any system with a browser that exists in the same network. 

Make sure to add your communication (Slack/Discord) tokens to the tokens.txt file if you want to get a notification with the discovered assets after recon process ends.

## Sample Token.txt ($HOME/ReconPi/configs/tokens.txt)

```
github_subdomains_token=""
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxx/xxx/xxx"
findomain_spyse_token=""
findomain_virustotal_token=""
findomain_securitytrails_token=""
CHAOS_KEY=""
hackerhandle="reconpi"
```

## Config Files (Note: config file for amass, subfinder and naabu are stored inside ReconPi/configs/ folder, provide your api keys in these files)

**Input your API keys in these files to get better results**

Subfinder Config file path : $HOME/ReconPi/configs/config.yaml

Amass Config file path : $HOME/ReconPi/configs/config.ini

We have added a `$hackerhandle` which is used in the nuclei scans. An additional `x-bug-bounty: reconpi` header will be added, please update this with your own handle :) 

## Scripts

- Script folder contains a script named **daily** which can be used as a cronjob to run subdomain enumeration automatically.

- Methodology is to take already enumerated subdomains as input and use amass on top of them, then track their last 2 result, and alert new subdomains on slack.

## Methodology
- gatherResolvers
- gatherSubdomains
- checkTakeovers
- getCNAME
- gatherIPs
- gatherScreenshots
- startMeg
- fetchArchive
- fetchEndpoints
- runNuclei
- portScan
- notifySlack

**Subdomain Enumeration:**
- Sublert
- Subfinder
- assetfinder
- amass
- findomain (Add findomain sources token to get better result)
- chaos dataset
- github-subdomains
- dns.bufferover.run
- Mutate above Subdomains using commonspeak subdomain list

- Combine and Sort above result -> Use shuffledns to resolve -> dnsgen(to mutate) -> httprobe (to get alive hosts)

- Check takeover using subjack and nuclei

- Get CNAME to check manually for takeovers

- Use dnsprobe to gather IP, ignore if they fall in cloudflare ip range

- Do masscan and then nmap scan on them, also use http-title and vulners script.

- Take Screenshot for visual recon

- Use gau to to get archive urls, get paramlist, jsurls, phpurls, aspxurls, and jspurls in there own files.

- Get Endpoints using Linkfinder

- Run Nuclei Scripts on alive hosts

- Notify on Slack channel if token is specified.

- Directory Buteforcing (Not enabled, as it takes long time, it is better to do manually)

More tools will be added in the future, feel free to make a pull request!
